# Build environment for the Linux dedicated server release.
#
# Debian 11 on purpose, not something current. glibc symbol versioning only
# works one way: a binary built against 2.31 runs on 2.35, never the reverse.
# Debian 11 gives glibc 2.31, so the release runs on Ubuntu 20.04 and anything
# newer, which covers every distro likely to end up on a VPS.
#
# Same reasoning as the deployment target on the Intel Mac slice: build against
# the floor, run everywhere above it.
